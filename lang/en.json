  "ourService.title": "Our Service",
  "ourService.p1": "Billions of dollars worth of crypto assets have been lost due to the lack of solutions to reclaim assets in self-custody wallets after the inevitable happens. We offer a {secure} and {trustless} solution that enables you to pass on your assets to your loved ones.",

  "howItWorks.title": "How it Works",
  "howItWorks.p1": "Our DApp allows you to create {vaults}. A vault is a set of smart contracts, just like a self-custody wallet, you have full control over its contents. Additionally, the vault enables you to define rules for how you want the assets to be distributed once you're gone. When you create a vault, you'll get a unique vault address, a {vaultKey} and you set a {deadline}. This deadline can be extended periodically to confirm you're alive, we call this {proofOfLife}. Owning a vault key token provides you with access to withdraw assets from the vault, regardless of the deadline.",
  "howItWorks.p2": "Within your vault, you have the ability to create subdivisions known as {pockets}, where you can allocate your assets. Subsequently, you can mint the corresponding {pocketKeys} to be distributed to the beneficiaries. These pocket key tokens enable beneficiaries to claim their share of the assets from the designated pockets once you are unable to prove your alive and after the vault's deadline has completely elapsed.",
  "howItWorks.p3": "With this DApp, your crypto assets can be reclaimed by your heirs after you pass away, in a trustless manner. Now, you can store your crypto assets with with greater peace of mind as you no longer need to entrust your seed phrase to a third party. Your vault, similar to a wallet, provides you full control and self-custody of your assets, but with added capabilities.",
  "howItWorks.p4": "GenWealth is the first inheritance protocol on {cardano}, we're planning to expand our service to other blockchains in the future. For more information on how our smart contracts work, you can read the code documentations {here}.",
