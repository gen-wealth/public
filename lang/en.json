  "ourService.title": "Our Service",
  "ourService.p1": "Billions of dollars worth of crypto assets have been lost due to the lack of solutions to reclaim assets locked in wallets after their owners are gone. We offer a {secure} and {trustless} solution that enables you to pass on your assets to your loved ones, providing peace of mind and ensuring the safe transfer of wealth.",

  "howItWorks.title": "How it Works",
  "howItWorks.p1": "Our DApp allows you to create {vaults}. A vault is a set of smart contracts, where you have full control over its contents, just like you would with a self custody wallet. In addition, with the vault you can define rules for how you want the assets to be distributed once you're gone. When you create a vault, you'll get a unique address, a {vaultKey}, and you set a {deadline}. This deadline can be postponed from time to time to prove that you're still alive, we call it {proofOfLife}. Possessing a vault key token in your wallet grants you access to withdraw assets from the vault at any time, irrespective of the deadline.",
  "howItWorks.p2": "Within your vault, you can create subdivisions called {pockets} where you allocate your inheritance assets across them. Next, you can mint the associated {pocketKeys} to be sent to the beneficiaries. It is these pocket key tokens that allow them to claim their share of the assets from the respective pockets once you're unable to prove that you're still alive, which occurs only after the vault's deadline has completely elapsed.",
  "howItWorks.p3": "With this DApp, your crypto assets can be reclaimed by the people you select after you're gone in a trustless manner. Now, you can store your crypto assets with more peace of mind because you no longer need to entrust your seed phrase to a third party. Your vault truly acts like a self-custody wallet, but with additional capabilities.",
  "howItWorks.p4": "GenWealth is the first inheritance protocol on {cardano}, we're planning to expand our service to other blockchains in the future. For more information on how our smart contracts work, you can read the code documentations {here}.",
