  "ourService.title": "Our Service",
  "ourService.p1": "Billions of dollars in crypto assets have been lost due to the inability to reclaim assets in self-custody wallets when seedphrases are lost or unexpected events happen to the owners. GenWealth helps you plan your crypto assets in a {secure} and {trustless} manner, ensuring they are managed according to your wishes in the event of unforeseen circumstances.",

  "howItWorks.title": "How it Works",
  "howItWorks.p1": "Our dApp allows you to create {vaults}, which are sets of smart contracts that function like self-custody wallets, giving you full control over their contents. With a vault, you can define rules for asset distribution after you pass away. When you create a vault, you receive a unique vault address, a {vaultKey}, and you also set a {deadline}. This deadline can be extended periodically as a {proofOfLife} to confirm you're alive.",
  "howItWorks.p2": "Within your vault, you can create subdivisions called {pockets} to allocate your assets. You can then mint corresponding {pocketKeys} to distribute to beneficiaries. These pocket key tokens allow beneficiaries to claim their share of the assets from the respective pockets once you are unable to prove you're alive, which occurs after the deadline has fully elapsed.",
  "howItWorks.p3": "With this dApp, your crypto assets can be reclaimed in a trustless manner after you pass away. This allows you to store your assets with **peace of mind**, eliminating the need to entrust your seed phrase to a third party. Your vault offers full control over your assets, functioning like a self-custody wallet but with added features.",
  "howItWorks.p4": "GenWealth is the first inheritance protocol on {cardano}, we're planning to expand our service to other blockchains in the future. For more information on how our smart contracts work, you can read the code documentations {here}.",
